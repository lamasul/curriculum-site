title: Metaphors
slug: workshop-1
readingTime: Est. 1 hour
excerpt: Metaphors, or symbolic representations of abstract concepts, are powerful tools for technologists. For example, two metaphors for a drone could be a “programmed bird” or a “mini airplane”. The metaphor we use for a particular technology will likely have an affect on how technology is designed, used, and even governed. In this workshop, high school students will explore the concept of a metaphor and learn about its implications on the technology lifecycle. Finally, they will practice “hacking the metaphor”, or challenging their own metaphors to come up with one that is a best representation of what they intend to create.

## Learning Goals

- Brainstorm a wide range of metaphors 

- Compare metaphors based on different values and contexts

## Game Instructions
- 1- First, take out a pen or sharpie and the eight “Metaphor cards”
- 2- In your group, come up with 8 metaphors for a home robot. On each Metaphor card:
- -  a- Draw a picture of your home robot if it was inspired by that metaphor
- -  b- Write the name of the metaphor
- -  c- Circle 2 normative goals that it promotes, and 2 that it demotes.
- 3- After Metaphor cards are created:
- - a- Shuffle the deck of scenario cards, and flip over the top card
- - b- Shuffle the metaphor cards, flip over the first two cards
- - c- Read the scenario card. Choose the metaphor card that would apply best for the scenario. Keep in mind the normative goals - assigned to the scenario and the metaphor.
- - d- Discard the losing metaphor card, and replace it with a card from the metaphors deck.
- - e- Choose another scenario card from the deck, and evaluate the two metaphors.
- - f- Repeat until you have one metaphor left.
